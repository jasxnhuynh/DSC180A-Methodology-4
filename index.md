### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
I found that the sheer scale of misinformation and subtle factual distortions in today's news media very interesting.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to investigate which news outlets fail factuality checks most often to see if there are certain stations that consistently produce more misinformation.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would incorporate more datasets to improve model robustness and generalizability, rather than relying heavily on a single labeled dataset.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I’d like to experiment with embedding-based models for detecting clickbait instead of the simpler heuristic method we currently use.
